# Features

The key components are explained in this section. First of all, we should start with the most important DataMiner Modules being used, behind the scenes but also from a user POV.
Next to that, we can go deeper into the most important integrations and building blocks of the environment. Nothing prevents you from using subpages, but keep it digestible and to the point. If possible, some links are added to CI/CD artifacts or development repositories of these components.

Examples:

* This could be ticketing which goes from the alarm console (with hyperlinks) towards an Automation Scripts which will interact with an Element which is interacting with Jira.
* This could be an SRM environment, where you mention how bookings are typically created (e.g. user-defined API, an element polling data, booking wizard, etc.) and potentially have subpages with the most important flavors or components within this solution.
* This could be a key 'manager' element doing a lot of behind-the-scenes logic in the background.
* This could be a low-code APP, quickly summarizing the most important pages & visuals. Also, the most important scripts being used for interaction or queries are quickly discussed.
