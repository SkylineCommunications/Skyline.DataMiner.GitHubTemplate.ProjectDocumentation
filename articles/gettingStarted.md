1. Refer to [Markdown](xref:markdown) for more information.
1. Consider using Mermaid for creating diagrams, etc. When creating images using Mermaid, take into account the dark and light themes. Make sure the images are readable in both themes.
1. Add image files to the *images* folder if the file is referencing an image.
1. Do not create lengthy pages. It is preferred to create smaller pages as the search is performed on page level.
