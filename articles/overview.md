# Overview

On this page, the purpose of the environment is documented with a high-level overview of the most important components (preferably in a clear visual (diagram)). Next to this, the importance of the cluster environment is indicated, compared to the other environments.

Adding to this, optionally you can also indicate the most important projects (with Collaboration links) in this environment. If you have multiple projects (e.g. extensions) you can summarize this in sub-levels.
